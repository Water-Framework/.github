 *"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."* - Bruce Lee

##  What is Water Framework ? <a name="introduction"></a>

![Water Framework Concepts](profile/images/water-framework-concepts.png)

Water framework is a "cross-framework" that is, it allows you to write modular applications that can run on different java runtimes (for the time being) such as spring,osgi, quarkus, etc...

The key feature of Water Framework is that it takes the form of the container that incorporates it (like water , precisely).

What are the main advantages of this framework? First of all it has a number of "out of the box" features such as:

* User management
* Granular permission system
* Integrations with different technologies
* Integrations for realtime/event streaming applications. 

In addition, all these features are customizable. Do you have needs to change the permission system to your liking and totally and/or partially override the default behavior ? No problem ! Water Framework has a 100% modular structure based on SOLID principles of object-oriented programming.
It was created to support all the latest technologies and defines a new "Convention over coding" development standard.

This means that the structure of applications follows certain mechanisms and dynamics that allows them to have truly simple code management (from development to build and deployment) and interface remoting.
"Convention over coding" is not just a "development to a standard" but a set of techniques, tools and code conventions that ,if followed, drastically cut down development time and especially code maintenance.

The way it is described, our solution sounds very similar to the classic "Convention over configuration." In reality, it is not.
The so-called "Convention over configuration" reduces the configurations to be specified by the developer who can rely on some "default" conventions of the technology used.

One example out of all: @Entity on a Java class will associate a table with the class name if not specified.
This type of approach is certainly useful and is currently used within the framework, but we have decided to go even further.

You might think that all these advantages require special libraries or constructs where you lose control of the code. They don't. Water Framework is extremely clear and has very simple concepts that do not complicate but rather help you structure your source code better.
In fact, you can design monolithic or microservices applications, or the classic "modulith" or hybrid of microservices and monoliths.

Water Frameowrk three main pillars are:

* Water Framework
* Tools (Water Framework Generator)
* Runtimes
